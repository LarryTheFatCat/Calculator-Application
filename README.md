# Calculator-Application
This application was bootstrapped with Create-Vite-App using the ReactJS framework.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start the development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run build` or `yarn build` builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
